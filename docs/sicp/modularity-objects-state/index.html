organizational principles that can guide us in formulating the overall design of a program.</p><p>In particular, we need strategies to help us structure large systems so that they will be <em>modular</em>, that is, so that they can be divided <em>naturally</em> into coherent parts that can be separately developed and maintained.</p><p>There are two prominent organizational strategies arising from two rather different <em>world views</em> of the structure of systems:</p><ul><li><p>object-based: viewing a large system as a collection of distinct objects whose behaviors may change over time.</p></li><li><p>stream-processing: concentrating on the streams of information that flow in the system.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assignment-and-local-state">Assignment and Local State<a class="hash-link" href="#assignment-and-local-state" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>An object is said to <em>have state</em> if its behavior is influenced by its history.</p><p>We can characterize an object&#x27;s state by one or more <em>state variables</em>, which among them maintain enough information about history to determine the object&#x27;s current behavior.</p><p>In a system composed of many objects, the objects are rarely completely independent. Each may influence the states of others through interactions, which serve to couple the state variables of one object to those of other objects.</p><blockquote><p>Indeed, the view that a system is composed of separate objects is most useful when the state variables of the system can be grouped into <em>closely coupled</em> subsystems that are only <em>loosely coupled</em> to other subsystems.</p></blockquote><p>For such a model to be modular, it should be decomposed into computational objects that model the actual objects in the system. Each computational object must have its own <em>local state variables</em> describing the actual object’s state. Since the states of objects in the system being modeled change over time, the state variables of the corresponding computational objects must also change. In particular, if we wish to model state variables by ordinary symbolic names in the programming language, then the language must provide an <em>assignment operator</em> to enable us to change the value associated with a name.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="local-state-variables">Local State Variables<a class="hash-link" href="#local-state-variables" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This uses the <code>set!</code> special form, whose syntax is</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#bfc7d5;--prism-background-color:#292d3e"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">(set! &lt;name&gt; &lt;new-value&gt;)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Here <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is a symbol and <code>&lt;new-value&gt;</code> is any expression. <code>set!</code> changes <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> so that its value is the result obtained by evaluating <code>&lt;new-value&gt;</code>.</p><p>In general, evaluating the expression:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#bfc7d5;--prism-background-color:#292d3e"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">(begin &lt;exp1&gt; &lt;exp2&gt; ... &lt;expk&gt;)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>causes the expressions <code>⟨exp1⟩</code> through <code>⟨expk⟩</code> to be evaluated in sequence and the value of the final expression <code>⟨expk⟩</code> to be returned as the value ofe the entire <code>begin</code> form.</p><p>Combining <code>set!</code> with local variable is the general programming technique for constructing computational objects with local state.

They have hidden time-varying local state. If we wish to write computer programs whose structure reflects this decomposition, we make computational objects whose behavior changes with time. We model state with local state variables, and we model the changes of state with assignments to those variables.</p><p>By introducing assignment and the technique of hiding state in local variables, we are able to structure systems in a more modular fashion than if all state had to be manipulated explicitly, by passing additional parameters.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-costs-of-introducing-assignment">The Costs of Introducing Assignment<a class="hash-link" href="#the-costs-of-introducing-assignment" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The advantage of local state assignment when modeling objects comes with a price: the program can no longer be interpreted in terms of the substitution model of procedure application. Moreover, no simple model with <em>nice</em> mathematical properties can be an adequate framework for dealing with objects and assignment in programming languages.</p><blockquote><p>Programming without any use of assignments, as we did throughout the first two chapters of this book, is accordingly known as <em>functional programming</em>. (No more assignment after first assignment?)</p></blockquote><p>Without assignment, that symbols in the language could be viewed as essentially names for values.</p><p>But, if the value of a variable can change, a variable can no longer be simply a symbol. Now a variable somehow refers to a place where a value can be stored, and the value stored at this place can change.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sameness-and-change">Sameness and change<a class="hash-link" href="#sameness-and-change" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>In general, we can determine that two apparently identical objects are indeed <em>the same one</em> only by modifying one object and then observing whether the other object has changed in the same way.</p><p>In general, so long as we never modify data objects, we can regard a compound data object to be precisely the totality of its pieces. But, this view is no longer valid in the presence of change, where a compound data object has an <em>identity</em> that is something different from the pieces of which it is composed. An object is still <em>the same</em> object even if some of its pieces change; conversely, two different objects can both exist with the same state information.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pitfalls-of-imperative-programming">Pitfalls of imperative programming<a class="hash-link" href="#pitfalls-of-imperative-programming" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>In contrast to <em>functional programming</em>, programming that makes extensive use of assignment is known as <em>imperative programming</em>.</p><p>In general, programming with assignment forces us to carefully consider the relative orders of the assignments to make sure that each statement is using the correct version of the variables that have been changed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-environment-model-of-evaluation">The Environment Model of Evaluation<a class="hash-link" href="#the-environment-model-of-evaluation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In our new model of evaluation, these places in which values can be stored will be maintained in structures called <em>environments</em>.</p><p>An environment is a sequence of <em>frames</em>.

The result of evaluating an expression depends not only on the expression itself, but also on whether the evaluation occurs before or after these assignment moments. Building models in terms of computational objects with local state forces us to confront time as an essential concept in programming.</p><blockquote><p>Before we introduced assignment, all our programs were time-agnostic, in the sense that any expression that has a value always has the same value.</p></blockquote><p>In real world, objects do not change one at a time in sequence. Rather, we perceive them as acting <em>concurrently</em> -- all at once.</p><p>So it is often natural to model systems as collections of computational processes that execute concurrently.</p><p>Even if the programs are to be executed on a sequential computer, the practice of writing programs as if they were to be executed concurrently forces the programmer to avoid inessential timing constraints and thus makes programs more modular.</p><p>In addition to making programs more modular, concurrent computation can provide a speed advantage over sequential computation.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-nature-of-time-in-concurrent-systems">The Nature of Time in Concurrent Systems<a class="hash-link" href="#the-nature-of-time-in-concurrent-systems" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Several processes may share a common state variable.

There are two important aspects to this requirement. First, it does not require the processes to actually run sequentially, but only to produce results that are the same as if they had run sequentially. Second, there may be more than one possible <em>correct</em> result produced by a concurrent program, because we require only that the result be the same as for <em>some</em> sequential order.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mechanisms-for-controlling-concurrency">Mechanisms for Controlling Concurrency<a class="hash-link" href="#mechanisms-for-controlling-concurrency" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A more practical approach to the design of concurrent systems is to devise general mechanisms that allow us to constrain the interleaving of concurrent processes so that we can be sure that the program behavior is correct.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="serializing-access-to-shared-state">Serializing access to shared state<a class="hash-link" href="#serializing-access-to-shared-state" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Serialization implements the following idea: Processes will execute concurrently, but there will be certain collections of procedures that cannot be executed concurrently. More precisely, serialization creates distinguished sets of procedures such that only one execution of a procedure in each serialized set is permitted to happen at a time. If some procedure in the set is being executed, then a process that attempts to execute any procedure in the set will be forced to wait until the first execution has finished.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="complexity-of-using-multiple-shared-resources">Complexity of using multiple shared resources<a class="hash-link" href="#complexity-of-using-multiple-shared-resources" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Serializers provide a powerful abstraction that helps isolate the complexities of concurrent programs so that they can be dealt with carefully and (hopefully) correctly.

With streams we can achieve the best of both worlds: We can formulate programs elegantly as sequence manipulations, while attaining the efficiency of incremental computation.</p><p>The basic idea is to arrange to construct a stream only partially, and to pass the partial construction to the program that consumes the stream. If the consumer attempts to access a part of the stream that has not yet been constructed, the stream will automatically construct just enough more of itself to produce the required part, thus preserving the illusion that the entire stream exists.</p><blockquote><p>Generator is one implementation of streams.</p></blockquote><p>The implementation of streams will be based on a special form called <em>delay</em>. Evaluating <code>(delay ⟨exp⟩)</code> does not evaluate the expression <code>⟨exp⟩</code>, but rather returns a so-called <em>delayed object</em>, which we can think of as a <em>promise</em> to evaluate <code>⟨exp⟩</code> at some future time. As a companion to delay, there is a procedure called <em>force</em> that takes a delayed object as argument and performs the evaluation—in effect, forcing the <em>delay</em> to fulfill its promise.</p><p>In general, we can think of delayed evaluation as <em>demand-driven</em> programming, whereby each stage in the stream process is activated only enough to satisfy the next stage. What we have done is to decouple the actual order of events in the computation from the apparent structure of our procedures. We write procedures as if the streams existed <em>all at once</em> when, in reality, the computation is performed incrementally, as in traditional programming styles.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="infinite-streams">Infinite Streams<a class="hash-link" href="#infinite-streams" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We can user streams to represent sequences that are infinitely long.

This makes it convenient to combine and compare components of state from different moments.</p><blockquote><p>For example, we can think of an entire time series/signal as a focus of interest, rather than the values of the state variables at individual moments.</p></blockquote><p>To handle infinite streams, we need to devise an order of combination that ensures that every element will eventually be reached if we let the program run long enough.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="streams-and-delayed-evaluation">Streams and Delayed Evaluation<a class="hash-link" href="#streams-and-delayed-evaluation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In general, <em>delay</em> is crucial for using streams to model signal-processing systems that contain loops.

This would outlaw loops.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="modularity-of-functional-programs-and-modularity-of-objects">Modularity of Functional Programs and Modularity of Objects<a class="hash-link" href="#modularity-of-functional-programs-and-modularity-of-objects" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>One of the major benefits of introducing assignment is that we can increase the modularity of the systems by encapsulating, or <em>hiding</em>, parts of the state of a large system within local variables. Stream models can provide an equivalent modularity without the use of assignment.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-functional-programming-view-of-time">A functional-programming view of time<a class="hash-link" href="#a-functional-programming-view-of-time" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We introduced assignment and mutable objects to provide a mechanism for modular construction of programs that model systems with state. We constructed computational objects with local state variables and used assignment to modify these variables. We modeled the temporal behavior of the objects in the world by the temporal behavior of the corresponding computational objects.</p><p>Now we have seen that streams provide an alternative way to model objects with local state. We can model a changing quantity, such as the local state of some object, using a stream that represents the time history of successive states. In essence, we represent time explicitly, using streams, so that we decouple time in our simulated world from the sequence of events that take place during evaluation. Indeed, because of the presence of delay there may be little relation between simulated time in the model, and the order of events during the evaluation.</p><p>From the point of view of one part of a complex process, the other parts appear to change with time. They have hidden time-varying local state. If we wish to write programs that model this kind of natural decomposition in our world (as we see it from our viewpoint as a part of that world) with structures in our computer, we make computational objects that are not functional—they must change with time. We model state with local state variables, and we model the changes of state with assignments to those variables. By doing this we make the time of execution of a computation model time in the world we are part of, and thus we get “objects” in our computer.</p><p>Modeling with mutable objects raise thorny problems of constraining the order of events and of synchronizing multiple processes. The possibility of avoiding these problems has stimulated the development of <em>functional programming</em> languages, which do not include any provision for assignment or mutable data.</p><blockquote><p>The functional approach is extremely attractive for dealing with concurrent systems.</p></blockquote><p>There are some time-related problems creeping into functional models as well. One particularly troublesome area arises when we wish to design interactive systems, especially ones that model interactions between independent entities. The trouble comes with the notion of <em>merge</em>. Such a merge is implemented to interleave these inputs in some way that is constrained by <em>real time</em> as perceived by mutations. Technically, <em>merge</em> is a relation rather than a function.</p><p>The need to introduce explicit synchronization to ensure a <em>correct</em> order of events in concurrent processing of objects with state. Thus, in an attempt to support the functional style, the need to merge inputs from different agents reintroduces the same problems that functional style was meant to eliminate.</p></div><footer
